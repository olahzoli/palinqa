### Tri-Layer Testing Framework

___Péter Földházi (Lead Software Test Automation Engineer at EPAM Systems)___

Automating tests is a popular topic in software development nowadays. Doing it effectively isn't that easy on the other hand. Creating a well structured testing framework is one of the solutions, but unfortunately not too many people know how to do it properly. In this presentation I will show you the general model of a good testing framework that I've been using for more than three years now. This approach will allow you to share your solution inside and outside of your project, which is especially useful in a company similar to EPAM. More and more projects in Budapest have been using it, and therefore both ramp-up and test script maintenance time were lowered greatly on our projects.
