# palinQA workshops: Writing Good BDD Scenarios

## What we'll do

Join us for the last this year's event and gain some more knowledge about BDD! This workshop-like event does not require to have a laptop with you and will be held in English. Liferay is kindly hosting us.

### Writing Good BDD Scenarios

Behavior Driven Development is an agile development technique that improves collaboration between technical and nontechnical members of the team, by exploring the problem using examples. These examples then get turned into executable specifications, often called ‘scenarios’. The scenarios should be easy to read by all team members, but writing them expressively is harder than it looks!

In this meetup you can learn the core concept of BDD and how to write expressive BDD scenarios. We’ll start by giving you an introduction to BDD. You’ll then be introduced to different writing styles by reviewing pre­pared scenarios.

We’ll be using Gherkin, the syntax used by Cucumber and SpecFlow but you won’t need a computer.
