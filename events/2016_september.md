### How testing has changed the product development at Liferay
__Máté Thurzó (Software Engineer @ Liferay)__

Liferay has introduced a regular testing department fairly late in its product lifecycle. Since then a lot of things have changed in the life of an average Liferay engineer. In this presentation, you will learn about Liferay's journey from testing little until now. Mate will also look into the crystal ball and try to predict the future for testing.

### Have you thought about your regression testing this week?
__Erik Hörömpöli (Software Tester @ TOPdesk)__

Erik is going to re-create a model raised by Richard Bradshaw who named it: [F.A.R.T](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2PUXqasvGI). It helps us to think about our regression testing and reminds us to constantly re-think it's strategy.

### The importance of a communicative tester and how to become one
__Lina Zubyte (Omega Tester @ Secret Sauce Partners)__

Testers are often the bearers of bad news. There may be tension rising and hurt feelings involved, but all this could be avoided if testers learned how to communicate better. Working as a lone tester, Lina had to learn how to show that testing is a great addition to the company by collaborating and dealing with all kinds of different professionals. She will share her personal learnings on what helped her to become a respected member of the team who is not avoided but actually called upon to test changes and to evaluate and help improve quality.
