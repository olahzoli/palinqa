Testers are often the bearers of bad news. There may be tension rising and hurt feelings involved, but all this could be avoided if testers learned how to communicate better. Working as a lone tester, Lina had to learn how to show that testing is a great addition to the company by collaborating and dealing with all kinds of different professionals. She will share her personal learnings on what helped her to become a respected member of the team who is not avoided but actually called upon to test changes and to evaluate and help improve quality.
