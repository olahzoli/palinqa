## Lean Coffee #1

This time we are going with a Lean Coffee&trade; format where it's all about discussions without any formal talks. We will gather up and set agenda for ourselves to talk about what we are interested in. Cool, huh?

On a Lean Coffee you sit with 6-8 people, sketch some subjects that you are interested in or bring up a problem you want to be solved on a post-it note, we vote and then talk about it with mild moderation. Simple as that!

Read more [here](http://agilecoffee.com/leancoffee/) or just ask in comments. A subject can be anything, really, something you are curious about, how testing looks like at other companies, security testing, or, a blogpost you recently read.
