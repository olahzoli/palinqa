## Mob Testing (CRAFT Edition)

### Mob Exploratory Testing Workshop
___[Llewellyn Falco](http://llewellynfalco.blogspot.hu/) - Agile Coach, Creator of ApprovalTests, Legacy Code Expert___
Exploratory testing is a learning­ intensive style of testing. It’s time to amp up our skills by learning from one another, and learn in a mob. With mob testing, the whole group works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer. With a specific communication style called Strong­style pairing, it connects the group of brilliant minds on a shared experience. Facilitated by an expert, it makes a great mechanism for building habits and transferring skills over passing knowledge.

In this workshop, we will work on:
* Building the good habits of skilled exploratory testing, layer by layer through creating shared learning experiences in a mob format;
* Different types of testing tasks as a group: from analyzing a user interface to analysing an individual feature; from relying on requirements documentation to free associations; from focusing on coverage to focusing on understanding problems; from user interface to peeking at the code; and from focusing on testing to focusing on teamwork dynamics.

We will [set the room up](/docs/mob_testing_setup.jpg) to two main roles: the mob and the observers in the fashion shown in the picture below. Observers can rotate into the mob and throughout the session play a significant role in regular retrospectives distilling learnings. Don't be afraid, you will not need technical skills to join the mob;
Join in to experience personally how exploratory testing is different from traditional testing and collect ideas to amplify your testing. With exploratory testing, we make best possible use of our limited time with intelligent testing that delivers results!
