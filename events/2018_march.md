## Reality Check: The role of manual testing in DevOps
__Ingo Philipp (Distinguished Evangelist @ Tricentis)__

Digital disruption is omnipresent. Organisations are asked (more than ever before) to constantly reinvent their businesses at the speed of ideas and to keep their customers at their epicenter at the same time. Venerable companies have become comfortable "breaking down silos", changing cultural norms and driving efficiency at all costs to always be one step ahead of their competition. It is not any longer the strongest that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change.
Change seems to be the only thing constant, the new currency, the silver bullet to withstand disruptive innovations in the market. Big words, such as DevOps, emerged out of this fear to be second-class, and even managed to penetrate into our daily testing routines. The need for speed has become imperative for all businesses, small, medium, large.
So, the following idea suggests itself: Are manual testing tasks going to die? We say: No! Itâ€™s manual checking that has to die, but (manual) testing will survive. Testing as creative, critical, and intellectually engaged thinking about a program will never die, even though it is ultimately manual in nature.
