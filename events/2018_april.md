## Improving Testing Skillset

### Effective Test Automation - Full Throttle Ahead
__Gergely Ágnecz (Test Engineer @ BlackRock)__

You will obtain valuable knowledge about what test automation is, and how it can be improved. At the beginning, I present the goals and fundamentals of automation, then we jump on the main problems we can encounter during our work, with examples. I will explain the concept of the test pyramid, and other different actions we can take to improve our work, with their impact on overall product quality.

Those who work as test automation engineers will have some new ideas to overcome their daily challenges with the help of the test pyramid and other mentioned points, while team leads and managers will see different actions which they can take to make their team's life easier and to improve the quality and their processes.

### Growing Up As A Tester
__Lilla Kovács (QA Specialist @ Quince)__

At first sight, software testing seems like a simple job: finding bugs and reporting them. The reality is that the role of the testers is way more complex than this.

There are many layers of this profession from documentation writing to project management tasks. A tester is never simply a goalkeeper at the end of the software development cycle, he or she has the impact on the whole process.

It is especially true in case of smaller companies, where usually one tester has to do every subtask of the process. As one of these people, I would like to share my story of growing as a tester, and through my story maybe we understand our role a bit a better.
