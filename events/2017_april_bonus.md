## Bonus CRAFT 2017 Edition with Maaret Pyhäjärvi

### Five Controversial Ideas to Increase Your Impact as a Tester
__Maaret Pyhäjärvi (Lead Quality Engineer @ F-Secure Corporation)__

Ever since I started my career in testing, there’s been a mantra I believe in: you should work in a way that you are better tester by the next day. To feed the learning loop, I do work but also focus on introspecting how I test and how I think. As a tester, I provide information by thinking well, both around our ideas and our implementation of those ideas.
In this talk, I want to introduce five controversial ideas that I’ve used in the last five years to increase my personal impact as a tester. I offer them as my experiences. “The value of another’s experience is to give us hope, not tell us how or whether to proceed”. –Peter Block in The Answer to How is Yes.
The ideas we discuss are:
• Stop writing bug reports
• When asked to test, refactor
• Release daily, even without test automation
• Explore while in production
• One computer for a group to work on
