## Meet&Greet: Exploratory beer testing

For the first event of this season, we decided to arrange an informal, but yet still creative meetup for getting to know each other by testing... beer.

Let's gather together, collaborate and have fun with people who have 'professional illness' and test everything and everywhere.

Agenda:
1) Introduction and assignment to groups
2) Getting beers (on your own expense)
3) Exploratory testing whether you got what you asked for
4) Sharing post test ideas and drinking more beer!

They sell you a beer. They have a fancy name for it, they promise it's not expired. That it has 6% alcohol in it and it's a fruity, brown lager. How would you go and find it out if those are all true?
